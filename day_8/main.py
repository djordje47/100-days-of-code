# Write 3 print statements inside the function.
# Call the greet() function and run your code.

# def greet(name):
#     print(f'Hi {name}, how are you?')
#     print(f'Hello {name}')
#     print(f'{name} can you hear me?')
# greet('Djole')

def greet_with(name, location):
    print(f'Hello, {name} are you at {location}')


greet_with(location='work', name='Jack')
